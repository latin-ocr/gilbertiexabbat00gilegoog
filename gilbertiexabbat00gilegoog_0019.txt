Gilbert to london as an able coadjutor aud
eheck on the Archbishop of Canterbury: but
this view of the case is hardly consistent with
some of the letters in the present collection,
and also with the assertion of some os Becket's
biographera, that Gilbert Biahop of Loadon
principally opposed Becket's elevation to the
see of Canterbury. In the first and second
porticus of thia collection the letters have
been printed without further regard to order
than the general classification above alluded
to. In the third part the letters are arranged

according to the personato whom they are
addressed‚ as for instance-l. to the Pope ;
2. to the Cardinals3 3. to the sons os the
Ohurch in genera13 4. to the Archbishops,

Bishops, Deans, Abbots, &c of the different
dioceses in alphabetioal order ; and 5. to Kings
and other lay persons, according to their dig-
nity: hut under each of these heads no at-⁴
tempt at arrangement hasbeen made, because
as all the letters in this collection, though ex-
tremely interesting in themselves, are princi-
pally valuable as referring to letters in Becket's
collection, the reader will iu that collection
find all the information which oan be given
him as to the order in which the letters of the
present collection are to be read.

But the Cave MS. contains many letters

written by other persons contemporary with
Gilbert Foliot. Some of them will be found
