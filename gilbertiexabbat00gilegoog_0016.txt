English history. The Reformation, which toolr¹ .
’ place in the Church three hundred years ago,

has undoubtedly tended to prejudice the public
against Thomas d Becket and the cause which '
he maintained: for the sams reason an undue '· '-
favour has been shewn to all those who ''
espoused the Kings party against him. Among
these stand pre-eminent Roger, Archbishop os
York, and Gilbert Foliot‚ Bishop of london. h
But the odium which has fallen on the name
of Becket, and the favour which has been
shown to his adversaries, if not wholly un-
deserved, have been bestowed alike, without
duly weighing the arguments that might be
adduced on either side. The volumes now
published will be found to throw the greatest
light on the controversy between the rival
Bishops, and it is important for the reader to
bear in mind that these letters probably contain
the utmost that could be brought ‘forward by Ι
those who took part with King Henry against

χ therlrchbishop of Canterbury. Butas it is not ,
desirable to separate the character and the
letters of Gilbert from the great cause in which
he took so prominent a part, these few re-
marks will suffice for an introduction to the Ι
present collection, and we shall reserve a more
l'ull examinatior of the question, till the whole ·
mass of documenta shall be made complete by
the publication of the letters of Becket and

those who espoused his part.
